    <h2>Kayrene Kelley</h2>
    <p>Hi everyone! My name is Kayrene and I live about an hour from BYU-I. My husband and I have been married for 27 years. 
        We have 6 children between us, 5 sons and 1 daughter. Our children have blessed us with 15 grandchildren and 2 great 
        grandchildren. With the exception of our daughter, the kids live close so we get to spend a lot of time with our 
        grandkids.</p>
    <p>Some of my hobbies are spending time with my grandkids, driving a semi or truck, raising goats, and crocheting. We have
        frequent sleepovers with the grandkids and spend time camping together in the summer. I drive truck every chance I get, 
        not as often as I would like. I have 8 adult goats and babies on the way. Last year I started chrocheting again and it 
        has proven to be a great way to unwind and relax. I have made 10 blankets so far and half done with the 11th.
    </p>
    <p>I work for the local school district as a para-professional aide. My job is to facilitate the online classes, however 
       that means I do everthing a teacher does accept put grades in Powerschool (the councelor puts my grades in) and attend RTI
       meetings. This segways into my education, I am getting a degree in Applied Technology so I can get paid for what I already do.
       I want to teach computer related classes for the rest of my career.
    </p>
    <p>The thing I love the most about BYU-I is the atmosphere. Most everyone is willing to help and work with eachother to be 
        successful. I have been a member of the church all my life. When I was a young girl, the church/mutual program introduced song 
        that had a profound effect on my life. It is also my favorite scripture. That song is "Love One Another" from John 13:34-35 <br>
        "34: A new commandment I give unto you, That ye love one another; as I have loved you, 
        that ye also love one another. <br>35: By this shall all men know that ye are my disciples, if ye have love one to another."<br>
        The other song that has had an effect on my life is "A Child's Prayer"
    </p>
    <p>This looks like a fun class, and a great semester. I look forward to working with everyone.</p>
