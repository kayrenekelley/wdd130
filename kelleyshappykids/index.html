            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>My name is Kayrene Kelley and I have been raising goats since 2005 when my boys Kolton and Eric 
            decided they wanted to do cows for 4-H. I told both boys that they needed to do a smaller animal first and I refused 
            to have sheep at my house, so the boys chose goats.
             <br>
            We did not know much about goats and so I found these goats for sale that would be old enough to show, and in all 
             our infinite knowledge we chose dairy goats. Kolton bought an Alpine and Eric bought a Nubian named Snickers.
            <br>
            We were told that we could breed Snickers to a Boar goat to get meat show goats to sell. We sold Koltonâ€™s Alpine Goat 
             and bred Snickers to get 2 kids. Kolton and Eric decided not to do goats again, so we were left with Snickers and her 
             daughter, Tootsie Roll. After that year we also sold Snickers, as once a dairy goat has kids, she produces milk and has 
            to be milked all year. 
            <br>
            Kolton was in FFA and decided to raise Boar goats for his FFA project, so we bought a purebred doe named Sapheria and 
            he started a breeding program that was not very successful. Tootsie Roll had kids, but it took a couple of years for 
            Sapheria to kid. After Kolton graduated, I took over the care of the goats. This began my adventure with goats.
            <br>
            I have a mixed breed line and a purebred line. I breed my Nannies to a purebred Billy and my heard has increased. My goal 
            has been to sell the kids for meat and improve the quality of my heard. My Billy has close relations to This year I have 
            purchased a new Nanny giving me 3 lines in hopes for improvement.
