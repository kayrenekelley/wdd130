            <h2>Intro</h2>
            <p>My name is Kayrene Kelley and I have been raising goats since 2005 when my boys Kolton and Eric 
            decided to do goat 4-H, in preparation for cow 4-H. I told both boys that they needed to do a smaller animal first.
            I had no idea of the journey it would lead us on. 
            </p>

        <section class="intr-msg2">
            <h2>In the Beginning</h2>
            <p> We did not know much about goats and so I found two for sale that would be old enough to show that August. In all 
                our infinite knowledge we chose dairy goats. Kolton bought an Alpine and Eric bought a Nubian named Snickers. After the
                purchase, we found out there was a show for meat goats as well and if the meat goat made weight, it would sell at the 
                4-H County Fair.

            <h2>What's Next</h2>
            <p>We were told that we could breed Snickers to a Boar goat to get meat show goats to sell. We sold Koltonâ€™s Alpine Goat 
                and bred Snickers to get show kids. Kolton and Eric decided not to do goats again, so we were left with Snickers and her 
                daughter, Tootsie Roll. After that year we also sold Snickers, as once a dairy goat has kids, she produces milk and has 
               to be milked all year. The next question is "Now, what are we going to do with the goats?"

            <h2>FFA Project</h2>
            <p>Kolton joined FFA in High School and decided to raise Boar goats for his FFA project, so we bought a purebred doe named 
                Sapheria and he started a breeding program. As most parents know, any program your child starts, the parents start it too. 
                We borrowed a buck and bred the does. Tootsie Roll had kids, but it took a couple of years for Sapheria to kid. After Kolton 
                graduated, I took over the care of the goats; beginning my adventure with goats.

            <h2>Goat Life Now</h2>
            <p> My goal is to sell goats for meat and improve the quality of my heard. My children have helped me a great deal over the 
                years to get where I am today. I have been able to get 6 does, one buck, and have a good breeding program. I have a mixed 
                breed line and a purebred line. I strive to always breed my does to a purbred buck to increase the quality of the herd. 
                Unfortunately, my current buck is related to several of my does, so I have to sell the offspring. Last year I purchased 
                a new doe giving me 3 lines for herd improvement. This fall I will trade for two more doelings to add to my herd.
