                <p>There are many things to think about before raising goats. We were lucky because I have an animal background.
                    Even though we had not raised goats, I had some idea of what we were getting into. I've learned a lot and have made 
                    decisions to better my establishment and share some wisdom.

            <h2>Enviornment</h2>
            <p>The home enviornment for goats include:

            </p>
                <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
                    <li>Clean shelter with good ventilation that allows the goat to get out of the weather. We designed kidding pens 
                        with doors that can be removed. I found it makes things easier when it is kidding time. My does are already 
                        accustomed to them. We also have other areas for shelter.

                    </li>
                    <li>A good fence is mandatory. You know the old saying about the grass on the other side. While there are 
                        other ways to build fence; I use 8ft by 4ft cow type panels with steel posts every 4 ft. Baby saver wire is a 
                        must as the kids can go right through the squares of the fence. We have added 2in by 4in rolled wire along the 
                        bottom to keep the kids in. Of course, walking the fence line is a must to keep it safe. Finally, to protect 
                        against predators, we have added a second panel to make the fence about 8ft tall.

                    </li>
                    <li>Separating goats is always an issue. When we first started, we had one big pen, it was very difficult to catch 
                        or separate the goats. One time I had to put a goat in a horse trailer for a couple of days to separate her from 
                        her daughter with new kids. Now I have a fence that separates 1/3 of the pen. This has been a great help when I 
                        have to catch, separate, or quarantine animals.

                    </li>
                    
                  </ul>
            
           </section>

            <h2>Health Care</h2>
            <p>Health care is a vital part of having a good strong herd. This includes food, minerals, water, inspections,
                hoof care, vaccinations, deworming/parasites, dental, and dehorning.
            </p>
                <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                    <li>Goats do fine with good hay that has small stems and is leafy. If possible, pasture grass in the summer
                        good for goat health, and they love it. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Clean water is a must for good health. Keep water containers clean and free of algae, summertime is the 
                        best time for growing algae. A water heater in the winter will always give your goats access to water. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Goats need minerals, depending on the area you live in will depend on the minerals your animals need. 
                        I like loose minerals over a mineral block. It is easier for the goats to get what they want.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sight inspections, in other words, looking at your animals, will help catch issues early. Check with your 
                        vet about issues to look for. Some easy things to spot: not moving around, bowing back, missing fur, weight
                        loss, diarrhea, or nasal discharge. When working with your goat feel for lumps/bumps.
                    </li>
                    <li>Keeping hooves trimmed is important for goat health. Long hooves effect their feet, walking, and 
                        running. I do not have the strength in my hands to trim anymore, so I must find someone to trim for me. 
                        They should be trimmed at least 3 times a year, more if needed. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Goats need vaccinations, kids need their first shots when about 3 to 6 weeks and a booster a month later. The 
                        adults need a booster every year. I give my goats Barvac CT. They also need to be dewormed. I try to give wormer 
                        2 to 3 times a year. Watch the instructions, some wormer should not be given to young and pregnant does. Check
                        with your vet for the best treatment.
                    </li>
                    <li>Goats do not have upper teeth in the front of their mouths. As they age it is important to keep an eye on them. 
                        When older, you may need to change their feed to a pellet that they can chew with their back teeth. 
                    </li>
                    <li>Horns or no horns? If you sell 4-H kids they will need to be dehorned at about 1 week old. If not, the 
                        decision is yours. I prefer to leave the horns after seeing the difference the goat has for defense in attacks. 
                        It can also help when trying to catch. The downside is that the horns can hurt you too.
                    </li>

            <h2>Kidding</h2>
            <p>When it is time for my does to kid, I make sure I am ready. I make sure I have a kidding pen ready, watch for signs, 
                and deal with issues. 
            </p>
                <ul style="list-style: circle;">
                    <li>Having a shelter for does to kid is mandatory. I have kidding pens, made from wood with 4 sides and a roof.
                        The kids need to be warm for at least a week. Fluffy soft straw works great, I prefer barley straw. I keep 
                        a heat lamp to help newborns regulate their heat. The last thing I make sure I have is a water bucket for 
                        my doe.
                    </li>
                    <li>There are signs to watch for when it is time to kid. The doe will show signs of delivery. Her utter will 
                        fill and get tight. Her lady parts will get soft and loose and will wiggle as she moves around. You may 
                        see discharge from her lady parts when very close. Some of my does will even hang out in the open kidding pen.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        No matter how much prep is done, there could be issues. I always have at least one person to call if I need help.
                        Some problems, one turned wrong, and needs to be turned and pulled. Having kids in the 
                        Winter is risky but 4-H kids have to be born in December/January. If it is too cold the ears could freeze 
                        and fall off. I keep a tote and heat lamp in the house to warm up cold kids in the winter. I keep my vets 
                        number handy as well.
