                <p class="sc-line">
                    Tootsie Roll was my first goat in 2006, she became more of a pet and would follow 
                    me around whenever I was outside. Her last kid was a white doeling that I named Caramel. 
                    Caramel was the mother of several Does in my herd. The two were inseparable. As Tootsie 
                    aged, I changed her feed and it was not too long before Caramel was in the same boat. 
                    The two lived together for 12 years, and had a special mother daughter bond. I have not 
                    seen that strong of a bond since.

                    In the winter of 2021, two of my Does had extra kids. The doeling from a litter of 3, we 
                    took in the house to warm up and decided to keep her in. The little buck came from a litter 
                    of 4. He was smaller than my Chihuahua and I did not expect him to live. He had been pushed 
                    away, not cleaned up, and barely alive, I took him in the house.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Both lived, but I work full time and could not take care of the kids during the week, so my 
                    sister Carol took them during the week, and I took them for the weekends. Her family fell in 
                    love with them and decided to keep both, naming the buck Gustloff and the doeling Gertrude. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Gus lived for about 2 years and died peacefully in his sleep. There must have been something 
                    wrong inside. Gerty however, is still living with Carol and her family. She thinks she is a 
                    dog and even tries to get into the house.

                    This year Half-Pint had 3 kids. After warming them up in the house, we took them 
                    back to her, and I talked to a friend who has a daughter that wants to do 4-H. 
                    The next morning, I brought the cold doeling in the house again and my friend 
                    picked her up and took her home. Honey-Crisp is doing well; however, she lost part 
                    of her ears (frozen). If she does not make it to the 4-H show or they do not sell 
                    her at the 4-H sale, I will buy her back.

                    the day until I could find someone to take them. I sent them to some people who raise 
                    all their kids on bottles and in the Fall, I will get 2 different doelings back that I 
                    can add to my herd.

                    Sapheria was our first purebred goat. Kolton bought her for an FFA project however she 
                    did not breed for two years. We were so excited when she was finally going to kid, but 
                    when we went to check on her; all three kids were stillborn. It was another few years 
                    before she was bred again. This time she delivered one big kid, concerned I contacted 
                    the vet, and he felt she was done.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One week later she tried to deliver the second kid that was stillborn. In the process 
                    of trying to help her deliver, the kid sloughed off in two pieces, one on the ground 
                    and one stayed inside Sapheria. It took about a year for her to die from frequent 
                    infections as her body tried to absorb the stillborn. The kid she delivered was a doeling 
                    and we named her Arriah and kept her to carry on the purebred line.

                    In 2020, I bred my does to a young buck. To my surprise, in the winter of 2021 all my Does 
                    delivered within 2 weeks. I did not have enough shelter for 6 does and 12 kids. Kolton and I 
                    discussed what to do in a very short time; we decided to take a metal window well, cover it 
                    with straw and enclose the west end with straw. Well, goat kids love to jump, climb, and play. 
                    They even got their moms involved. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    By the end of this experiment, there were about 20 bales of straw packed down and scattered in 
                    the goat pen. Unfortunately, that shelter was a poor choice, it did not keep ears from freezing 
                    and I had to have the fence taken down and the pen cleaned out. The goats had fun though.

                    One of the kids born in 2021 was a chocolate-colored buck. He was born to a first-time mother, 
                    Kit-Kat, and she delivered him in the snow by the fence. He was slick and slid through the squares 
                    and was very cold. We took him in and warmed him up and returned him to Kit-Kat, after a few days I 
                    watched him follow Kit-Kat around with a bowed back. He looked weak so I took him back into the house 
                    and thought he would die. I called him Buddy.   
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Buddy fought for 2 months to live and was thriving. We had moved him and 2 others outside, he was 
                    healthy, bottle fed and eating hay. One day, a few weeks later, he got sick. As hard as he fought, 
                    again, he lost the battle. I share his story because of his determination to live.

                <p class="sc-line">
                    Last summer (2024) I had kids born to my Does. One of the doelings had a physical reaction to something. 
                    Her lips and nose cracked badly. I consulted my vet and he was not sure what might be wrong. I treated 
                    it with an antibiotic and pain reliever. The illness acted more like an allergy. She seemed to get better, 
                    but it did not last. Within about a month the doeling had massive drainage out of her eyes and nose and 
                    finally got to the point where I knew she was not going to live and was suffering. I finally made the 
                    decision to have my son put her down.

                <h4>Dog attack</h4>
                <p class="sc-line">
                    In the winter of 2020 (just before the Covid shutdown), while working on my computer, I heard dogs barking 
                    outside. It took a few seconds to realize my dogs were in the house. Two dogs from up the road jumped over 
                    the fence and attacked the goats. By the time we got outside Tootsie Roll had been killed and her daughter 
                    Caramel was bleeding freely from bites in her leg. After 12 years with her mother Caramel was alone. Finally, 
                    Arriah (pregnant) was limping badly where the dogs had gotten ahold of her hind leg and tried to drag her. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Within a year I had to have Caramel put down, she never recovered. Arriah delivered 2 kids but died suddenly 
                    when the kids were just old enough to wean. Because of this attack, we have most of the pens fortified with 
                    about 8ft fences. The dogs were taken and put in the pound and the owners had to pay a fine, it was the third 
                    reported incident and the second time they had killed a goat. The owners of the dogs slunk away without an 
                    apology, or financial restitution for damages.
