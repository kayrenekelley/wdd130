                    Rose is from the mixed breed line. She is not too friendly, but a great mom. Last year I lost Daisy (Doe) 
                    who had 2, two-week old kids; and Rose lost two kids (stillborn) the same day. I was able to get her to adopt the 
                    motherless kids and raise them as her own. I hope she is bred again so I do not have to sell her.

                <p class="doe-line">
                    Candy is from the mixed breed line. She has been a little aggressive and combative. Lately she has been friendly
                    and wants to be groomed, but has not bred back. She is protective so I have kept her as a line of defense from 
                    coyotes and dogs. She is Caramel's last kid, I really hope she might have one more set of kids with a doe we 
                    can keep.

                <p class="doe-line">
                    Kit-Kat is from the mixed breed line. She is a great mom, who comes from a line of great moms. She is very shy 
                    and does not like to be handled. She has kidded young with a lot of brown but so far not a doeling. I love her color
                    and hope she has a doe we can keep. The other does are not very nice to her, maybe if I get more colorful does they 
                    will back off.

                <p class="doe-line">
                    Ruby is from the 1st purebred line. She is a great mom. She is very protective and will defend against dogs and 
                    coyotes. She has also been very gentle with me this winter and let me check her. She dilivered 4 kids, all alive,
                    about the same size, and stood while I helped each one nurse. We took the two weakest ones as they would not 
                    have survived. This is the second time Ruby has delivered 4 kids, the last time one was stillborn.

                <p class="doe-line">
                    Garnet is from the 1st purebred line. Her mother is Ruby. She has only had one pregnancy but is a good mom. I hope she
                    has bred back, but she is not showing signs yet. She does not like to be handled and shies away from people. She has a 
                    bright future here.

                <h4>Carmel</h4>
                <p class="doe-line">
                    Carmel is the 2nd purebred line. A little girl raised her as a 4-H goat and she did not make weight. Her parents 
                    could not keep her and Sophie was devistated Carmel would be sold for meat. I agreed to buy her and put her in my 
                    herd. Carmel is a yearling with ties to my buck. I will be able to breed her but not keep the kids. She was bottle 
                    fed, and super friendly; basically a nuisance who loves attention.

            <section class="half-pint">
                <img class="doe-img" src="styles/images/rsz_halfpint-(2).jpg" alt="Half-Pint">
            <div class="doe-text">
                <h4>Half-Pint</h4>
                <p class="doe-line">
                    Half-Pint is the 3rd purebred line. Her parents are not related to my stock, giving me a clean line to start. She 
                    has been a gentle, freindly goat. She dilivered 3 kids this year and is a great mom with a gentle disposition, 
                    however, do not let the dog in the pen. She is protective of her kids and will go through you to get to the dog. 
                    Like Kit-Kat, Half-Pint has a lot of color and while this time her babies do not have the extra color I hope she will 
                    throw more color next time.

            <div class="doe-text">
                <h4>Appollo</h4>
                <p class="doe-line">
                    Appollo is from a neighbors purebred line. He is gentle and easy to work with. His main flaw is that he is related
                    to some of my does but is still okay to breed. Right now he is with some young bucks and is always at the gate when we need
                    to go in. I think he misses his ladies. To get on a 4-H schedule, he will have to wait until fall to see his ladies again.
                    He has been a great breeder and throws beautiful kids.
