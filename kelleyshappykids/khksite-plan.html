        [Introduction: My name is Kayrene Kelley and I have been raising goats since 2005 when my boys Kolton and Eric 
        decided they wanted to do cows for 4-H. I told both boys that they needed to do a smaller animal first and I refused 
        to have sheep at my house, so the boys chose goats.
        <br>
        We did not know much about goats and so I found these goats for sale that would be old enough to show, and in all 
        our infinite knowledge we chose dairy goats. Kolton bought an Alpine and Eric bought a Nubian named Snickers.
        <br>
        We were told that we could breed Snickers to a Boar goat to get meat show goats to sell. We sold Koltonâ€™s Alpine Goat 
        and bred Snickers to get 2 kids. Kolton and Eric decided not to do goats again, so we were left with Snickers and her 
        daughter, Tootsie Roll. After that year we also sold Snickers, as once a dairy goat has kids, she produces milk and has 
        to be milked all year. 
        <br>
        Kolton was in FFA and decided to raise Boar goats for his FFA project, so we bought a purebred doe named Sapheria and 
        he started a breeding program that was not very successful. Tootsie Roll had kids, but it took a couple of years for 
        Sapheria to kid. After Kolton graduated, I took over the care of the goats. This began my adventure with goats.
        <br>
        I have a mixed breed line and a purebred line. I breed my Nannies to a purebred Billy and my heard has increased. My goal 
        has been to sell the kids for meat and improve the quality of my heard. My Billy has close relations to This year I have 
        purchased a new Nanny giving me 3 lines in hopes for improvement.]

        Meet my Nannies and Billy
        <br>
        <br>
        This page will show pictures of my current goats and something about each one. It will be small pictures with 
        the names underneath. I will talk about some of the things my boys and I have done to make things run smoother. 
        I will share plans for my goats, and what I hope to do in the future.
        <br>
        Nannies:
        <br>
        Rose; mixed breed line. She is not too friendly, but a great mom. I lost a Nanny last year and she lost her kids 
        the same day. I was able to get her to adopt the motherless kids and raise them as her own.
        <br>
        Candy; mixed breed line. She has been a little aggressive and combative. Lately she has been friendly but has not 
        bred back. She is protective so I have kept her as a line of defense from coyotes and dogs.
        <br>
        Kit-Kat: mixed breed line. She is a great mom, very shy and does not like to be handled.
        <br>
        Ruby; 1st purebred line. She is a great mom. She is very protective and will defend against dogs and coyotes. 
        <br>
        Garnet; 1st purebred line. She has only had one pregnancy but is a good mom. She does not like to be handled.
        <br>
        Carmel; 2nd purebred line. She is a yearling and from a different line than my other purebreds but is closely 
        related to Appollo. She was bottle fed and super friendly and loves attention.
        <br>
        Half-Pint: 4th purebred line. Her parents are not related to my stock, giving me a clean line to start. She is a 
        great mom with a gentle disposition.
        <br>
        Billy:
        <br>
        Appollo; purebred line; he is gentle and easy to work with. He is closely related to some of my Nannies but okay to breed.]
